# ### Main boundary element calculations
#
# In `run_job` function, `job` is `Configuration` instance and `grid` is discretirized spatial grid (not the mesh). The general workflow (also the routine of BEM method) are:
# 1. `solve_singularities()` solves charge distributions by iterative methods to make it consistent with one electrode at 1V and others at 0V (unit potentials). `adapt_mesh()` refines meshes adaptively to achieve certain precision while solving sigulartities.
# 2. Compute potentials on given grid points by `simulate()`, based on the charge distributions gotten previously.
# 3. Potential data of each unit potential are saved seperately to a `Result` instance, and also export to VTK files.
# 4. Return total accumulated charge per electrode in the end.
#
# Major calculations calls `fastlap` C library which uses a pre-conditioned, adaptive, multipole-accelerated algorithm for solving Laplace problem. Two parameters control multipole acceleration.
# + num_mom, the number of multipole
# + num_lev, the number of levels in the hierarchical spatial decomposition.
# num_lev=1 means direct computation without multipole acceleration. See fastlap ug.pdf and README.rst.

# Create a grid in unit of scaled length `l`. Only choose the interested region (trap center) to save time.
# For reference, to compute Seidelin trap, grid shape = (60, 60, 60) takes 266 s, while shape = (150, 150, 150) takes 3369 s.

# ni is grid point number, si is step size. Thus to fix size on i direction you need to fix ni*si.
